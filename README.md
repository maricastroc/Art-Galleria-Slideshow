## üìö Project Description
Welcome to the Art gallery slideshow project build with ReactJS, with masonry layout, slideshow presentation, and lightbox view! This is a solution to the challenge [Galleria Slideshow Site](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/galleria-slideshow-site-tEA4pwsa6)

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slideshow and view each painting in a lightbox

## üìå What did I learn?

In this project, I had the opportunity to practice working with ReactJS, using concepts like states, immutability, properties, components, context and keys. I was also able to practice many design features (masonry layout, slideshow presentation, lightbox view) and to use a Mobile First approach in order to favor responsive design.

Additionally, I had the opportunity to work with React Router DOM, gaining experience in passing parameters between routes. This allowed me to create a gallery on the Home page where each painting could navigate to a separate route displaying its specific details
